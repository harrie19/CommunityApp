=== Bahai Community Android App - Build Attempt Log ===

[2025-10-29 23:24:59] Starting build process for Bahai Community App

ENVIRONMENT CHECK:
- Platform: Linux-5.10.134-18.al8.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.36
- Java: NOT AVAILABLE (required for Android build)
- Node.js: v18.19.0 (available)
- npm: 9.2.0 (available)
- Android SDK: NOT CONFIGURED

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:

1. GRADLE WRAPPER ISSUE:
   - Problem: gradlew script has incorrect line endings (CRLF instead of LF)
   - Root Cause: Created scripts with "// FILE:" prefix which corrupted shell scripts
   - Impact: gradlew script cannot execute
   - Solution: Scripts need to be recreated without "// FILE:" prefix

2. JAVA INSTALLATION:
   - Attempted: apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk
   - Result: Timeout after 60 seconds
   - Impact: Cannot proceed with Android build without Java
   - Alternative: Manual Java installation required

3. NPM PERMISSION ISSUES:
   - Problem: npm install fails with EACCES errors
   - Cause: npm trying to install globally in /usr/local/lib/node_modules
   - Mitigation: Modified setup_and_build.sh to skip backend if npm install fails
   - Backend stub created but cannot be tested without dependencies

BUILD STATUS: INCOMPLETE

FILES SUCCESSFULLY CREATED:
- Complete Android app structure with Jetpack Compose UI
- Room database with entities and DAOs
- Hilt dependency injection setup
- Repository pattern with offline-first architecture
- Backend stub with Node.js/Express
- Unit and UI tests
- CI/CD configuration
- Build and setup scripts

NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:
1. Install Java 17: sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
2. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
3. Install Android SDK and set ANDROID_HOME
4. Fix gradlew line endings (convert CRLF to LF)
5. Retry build: ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

For manual backend setup:
1. cd backend-stub
2. npm install --no-package-lock
3. npm start
